Data Cleaning
Prior to the analysis of the dataset, I took it upon myself to carefully go through data cleaning to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This process involved thoroughly scrutinizing each data column for any inconsistencies, errors, outliers and duplicates.
However, I discovered the dataset was already cleaned. Hence, it was ready for thorough analysis. For the sake of this analysis, Microsoft Excel was used for the data exploration and analysis.
The first step was to import the raw dataset into Microsoft Excel. This involved opening a new Excel sheet and selecting the “Data” tab from the top menu. From there, I selected “From Text/CSV” and browsed for the dataset file. After selecting the file, I clicked “Import” to bring the data into Excel.
